(2023)</div>\n<div class='paper-section'><b>SUMMARY:</b> This paper proposes a hybrid Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) edge computing framework designed for marine Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Addressing the challenges of efficiently and reliably collecting and computing vast amounts of maritime data under extreme channel conditions, the system integrates LEO satellites and UAVs as mobile edge servers within a space-air-sea network. The primary objective is to minimize the total energy consumption of battery-constrained UAVs by jointly optimizing the bit allocation for communication and computation, alongside UAV path planning, while adhering to latency, energy budget, and operational constraints. The authors develop solutions for three distinct LEO accessibility scenarios (\"Always On,\" \"Always Off,\" and \"Intermediate Disconnected\") using successive convex approximation (SCA) strategies. Numerical results confirm that this joint optimization approach significantly saves energy across all scenarios compared to partial optimization methods.</div>\n<div class='paper-section'><b>KEY HIGHLIGHTS:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Proposes a novel hybrid LEO and UAV edge computing architecture for marine IoT systems, forming a space-air-sea integrated network.</li>\n<li>Utilizes LEO satellites and UAVs as mobile edge servers endowed with computational capabilities for real-time processing of large maritime data.</li>\n<li>Aims to minimize the energy consumption of battery-constrained UAVs by jointly optimizing bit allocation (for communication and computation) and UAV path planning.</li>\n<li>Considers practical operational constraints including latency, energy budget, and different levels of LEO satellite accessibility (\"Always On,\" \"Always Off,\" and \"Intermediate Disconnected\").</li>\n<li>Leverages successive convex approximation (SCA) strategies to solve the complex joint optimization problem.</li>\n<li>Demonstrates through numerical results that joint optimization of bit allocation and UAV path planning leads to significant energy savings across all LEO accessibility cases compared to partial optimization schemes.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class='paper-section'><b>\ud83d\udd17 RELEVANT RESOURCES:</b>\n<div class='resource-links'>\n<a href='https://github.com/search?q=Marine+IoT+Systems+with+Space-Air-Sea+Integrated+Networks:+Hybrid+LEO+and+UAV+Edge+Computing' target='_blank' class='resource-btn github'>\ud83d\udc19 GitHub</a>\n<a href='https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Marine+IoT+Systems+with+Space-Air-Sea+Integrated+Networks:+Hybrid+LEO+and+UAV+Edge+Computing' target='_blank' class='resource-btn youtube'>\ud83d\udd34 YouTube</a>\n<a href='https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Marine+IoT+Systems+with+Space-Air-Sea+Integrated+Networks:+Hybrid+LEO+and+UAV+Edge+Computing' target='_blank' class='resource-btn reddit'>\ud83d\udc7d Reddit</a>\n</div>\n</div>",
